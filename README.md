# FRC-Main-2022

This is our main code-base for the 2022 frc season. Everything is programmed in C++, using 2022.2.1 wpilib vs code.
(If used in future seasons the project will need to be updated to the current version of wpilib, vs code should ask if you'd like to do so when opening the project folder)

As well, if any errors occur with vs code not fing your header files (such as <frc/Joystick.h>), use the palette command “>WPILib C++: Refresh C++ Intellisense” to refresh intellisense (Exculding quotations).

The libraries we've added for the ADIS16470 IMU may be removed, as the necessary drivers now come pre-included with wpilib.
